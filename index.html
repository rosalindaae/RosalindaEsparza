        Hello, my name is Rosalinda Esparza, I am a first year at UC Riverside with a major in pre-business. I aspire to join the Business Administration major once I am eligible to apply in my junior year of University. I am determined to pursue this major because i aspire to have a carrear in Finance and eventually be able to own many businesses of my own. I would love to open businesses that will effect my community postively! For insance, homeless shelters, food banks, librarys, etc. I also aspire to eventually open up restuarnts all over mexico and give a partial amount to many charities. I have a very overwehlming passion of helping others by providing people with what they need. I grew up and currently live in a low income Community where I see that many people arent even able to get basic necesities like food, water, a place to shower, or a shelter. It breaks my heart everytime I have to see a man or women struggling in the streets, even if its their fault or not i belive that as human beings everyone deserves to have those basic necesities.   <br><br>

        My skills include being a team player while also being able to work independently. I am great at creating a safe and comfortable eviorment for my co-workers. I love hearing other peopleâ€™s ideas and involvement to create an amazing outcome in whatever it is we are striving for. I never shy away from asking for help and coming to others in times that I dont understand the assignment after thinking it over many times. I much rather get help from my peers than have a negative impact on the project because of lack of understanding or poor misunderstanding.I also have the ability to multitask between countless different projects, intermediate and elaborate. I always finish what I started and never leave anything half ways because I know that when I commit myself to a project or assignment I hold the responsiblity of completing it. Another great skill I have is my communication skills, I have worked in the food service for four years now which has allowed me an enourmous amount of time to practice and perfect my communication skills which comes in handy in every job. Another job ive had is touroring in math which will be extremely benifical in the business and finance carrear im aspiring in because I know that a large part of being an accountant of some sort is being able to expain to others the math behind numbers weither that may be to my co-works or to my clients themselves. Ultimately I know that many people may disagree with me going to University as a major in business and Administration because openig up a business these days literally just takes a instagram page however I decided to study for this major because I  want to be informed in what im doing and eventually I  dont want to have to hire someone to do the work that I can learn to just do myself. Therefore I am willing to get as much experiance I  can because I want later apply those Additional new skills I learn into when I build my own empir. I dont have much experience in that field but im very much egar to start .
